    <!-- FAQ -->
    <section id="faq" class="flex flex-col items-center py-16">
        <h1 class="font-bold text-xl text-center">Got Questions? We've Got Answers.</h1>
        <span class="opacity-50 text-sm mb-4 text-center px-2">Browse through our most frequently asked questions to find clarity on our services, pricing, and how we can help you stay illuminated.</span>

        <section class="w-full max-w-3xl px-4">
            <faq-item question="How long does each daily conversation scenario take to complete?" answer="Most scenarios take 10-15 minutes to complete, including the conversation itself and the AI feedback review. Some complex scenarios like business negotiations or medical consultations may run closer to 20 minutes. You can pause and return to a scenario anytime if you need to step away." />
            <faq-item question="What level of proficiency do I need to start using the platform?" answer="The platform works best for learners at A2 (upper beginner) level and above. You should be able to form basic sentences and understand simple responses. Complete beginners may find the conversational format overwhelming, but we offer a guided mode with sentence starters and vocabulary hints for those still building foundational skills." />
            <faq-item question="Can I repeat scenarios if I want more practice with a particular situation?" answer="Yes, absolutely. You can replay any scenario as many times as you want. The AI will vary its responses each time to keep the conversation fresh, so you won't just be memorizing one correct path. Many users repeat challenging scenarios like job interviews or apartment viewings multiple times until they feel confident." />
            <faq-item question="Does the conversation practice include voice/speech recognition, or is it text-based only?" answer="The platform is currently text-based only. While this means you won't practice pronunciation, it allows you to focus entirely on constructing natural sentences and choosing appropriate vocabulary without the added pressure of speaking aloud. Voice features are planned for future releases." />
            <faq-item question="How does this differ from using ChatGPT or other general-purpose AI tools for language practice?" answer="General AI tools aren't designed for language learning. They'll often accommodate your mistakes rather than correct them, won't track your patterns over time, and lack the structured scenarios and cultural context our platform provides. Our feedback AI is specifically trained to identify language errors and explain why something sounds unnatural, while ChatGPT is optimized to understand you despite errors, not help you improve." />
            <faq-item question="Can AI make mistakes in conversations or feedback?" answer="Yes. AI can occasionally generate unnatural phrasing, make cultural missteps, or miss subtle errors in your responses. While we've designed the system to be reliable, it's not perfect and shouldn't replace human instruction entirely. Think of it as a supplementary practice tool, not a definitive authority. We encourage users to cross-reference important corrections with native speakers or teachers when possible." />
